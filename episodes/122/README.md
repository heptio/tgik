## Week in Review

### K8s Core

- 1.19 is still in beta2, no changes the last 2 weeks.
- Release team has [lots of point release goodies this week](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/kubernetes-dev/c/j6qzDkMh-mE)
    - "As a general note, hyperkube is deprecated and will NOT be present in the v1.19.0 release or any releases > v1.19.0. Please, if you're using hyperkube for older releases (v1.18.z --> v1.16.z), make plans to migrate away from it as a deployment strategy. We have extremely limited capabilities to test hyperkube and support for it should be considered to be "best-effort"."
