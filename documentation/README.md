# TGIK Documentation

This will mostly be internal, but sharing broadly as a resource.

## Creating the Checklist

Start by copying the following into the issue for the episode. Check things off as you do them.

```markdown
The process for producing an episode is [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tgik/blob/master/documentation/README.md).  All the detail for the steps below is there.

Monday or Tuesday:
* [ ] Pick a topic and create/use an issue in the repo
* [ ] If applicable coordinate with an upstream project if they're interested in attending the show
* [ ] Create the graphic
* [ ] Schedule on Youtube
* [ ] Add scheduled episode to TGIK playlist on YT
* [ ] Create short link in rebrandly
* [ ] Tweet about it from your personal account
  * [ ] Post tweets on internal #tgik slack channel and cc @castrojo and Vykky
  * [ ] Get confirmation from boschem that she's seen the tweet and is scheduling it

Before episode:
* [ ] Create HackMD page for live notes.  Start with README template in this repo
* [ ] Paste HackMD URL on internal #tgik channel and cc @castrojo or other assistant
  * [ ] Assistant adds ~5-10 news items from around the web as possible "News of the Week"
* [ ] Get everything tested well before episode so you can debug
* [ ] Use internal slack channel to ensure that AV setup is good


After show (ideally right away but can wait until Monday):
* Create/submit PR for this repo
  * [ ] Episode directory and README from hackmd
  * [ ] Any other files from the episode that might be useful
  * [ ] Update playlist.md with episode
  * Feel free to self merge
* [ ] Edit YT description to point to episode directory here
* [ ] OBS/OS Upgrade if applicable (Never on the day of a show)
```

## Creating the graphic

Find an image to use that is fun and subtly hints at the topic for the episode.
For example [episode 38](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tgik/tree/master/episodes/038) was on Kata containers, and the [supporting image was of containers in a shipyard](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tgik/blob/master/episodes/038/038.png).

#### [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) (Mac/Windows):

1. Open `graphics/title-card.ai` with Adobe Illustrator.
1. Delete the old image and use the "File | Place" to insert the new image. Move that to the back with "Object | Arrange | Send to Back".
1. Select the semi-transparent background on the text and the logo box and use the eye dropper tool to pick a light color out of the image.
1. Export to PNG in the same folder using "File | Export | Export for screens"
  * Before saving make sure you change the name of the artboard (which determines the filename) by double clicking it on that dialog.
  * Export as PNG at 1x
  
#### [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (Linux/Mac/Windows):

1. Open `graphics/title-card.svg` with inkscape.
 
    ```bash
    inkscape graphics/title-card.svg
    ```

1. Open the layers panel (`ctrl+shift+L`).

    [![](imgs/inkscape-open.png)](imgs/inkscape-open.png)

1. Select the background image (ensure `Background` layer is selected).
1. Right click on the background image.
1. Choose `Release Clip`.
 
    [![](imgs/inkscape-release-clip.png)](imgs/inkscape-release-clip.png)
    > This reveals two objects in the layer `Background`. The background image, which you'll replace, and a semi-transparent box representing the 1280x720 area to trim a background image to.

1. Delete the existing background image.
1. Paste in a new background image.
    * We often use [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/); If not unsplash, ensure we have rights to use the image.
1. Move the new background image object behind the semi-transparent box 
    * `PgDn` or `Menu Bar > Object > Lower to Bottom`
1. Move/Scale the background image around to fit desirably in the semi-transparent box.
1. Select the background image and semi-transparent box.
1. Right click and `Set Clip`.
 
    [![](imgs/inkscape-set-clip.png)](imgs/inkscape-set-clip.png)

1. Use the Text Tool (`T`) to update the episode number (`Ep 120` -> `Ep 121`).

1. Select all semi-transparent elements (text + vmware/k8s background) 
 
1. Set their color by using the dropper (`D`) and clicking somewhere in the image.
 
    [![](imgs/inkscape-dropper.png)](imgs/inkscape-dropper.png)

1. Export using `Menu bar > File > Export PNG Image`.

1. Save to `episodes/${EPISODE_NUMBER}/tgik${EPISODE_NUMBER}.png`.

## Setup OBS

#### If you don't already have an OBS configuration for TGIK:

1. Import the OBS profile from the repository.

    * `Profile > Import` choose `obs-config/profiles/TGIK`.

1. After importing check the `Profile` and `Scene Collection` menus to ensure `TGIK` is set.
1. Further configure the scenes to hook up your mic, screen, and webcam.
    > Note: Configuring and tuning OBS is an exercise in itself. If you're a first-time OBS user, consider reaching out to someone in the [internal] #tgik channel to get a walkthrough.

#### Preparing OBS for Stream:

1. Open `File > Settings > Stream`.

1. Open the Live Control Room for your upcoming stream.

    [![](imgs/yt-ctrl-room.jpg)](imgs/yt-ctrl-room.png)

1. Start the stream in OBS.
1. Verify:
    * Connection is excellent
    * Test chat message comes through to OBS

    [![](imgs/obs-full-test.png)](imgs/obs-full-test.png)

## Starting the Stream

1. Follow the steps in [Testing the Stream](#testing-the-stream) above. 
1. Click Go Live in the Live Control Room.
